# Playing-the-Nimble-Ninja-game-with-Neural-Networks-in-Swift-3
Creating a Nimble Ninja game that utilizes a neural network in Swift 3 is an interesting challenge. In this task, we will combine game development with machine learning to create an AI agent capable of playing the game.

We’ll go over the basic steps:

    Create the Nimble Ninja Game: This will involve setting up the gameplay, controls, and UI.
    Implement Neural Network: We'll use the basic structure of a neural network to train an agent to play the game.
    Integrate the AI into the Game: Train and implement the AI agent to interact with the game environment.

We'll break this down, but since Swift 3 does not have built-in machine learning support like modern versions (Swift 4 or 5 with CoreML), we will focus on a simple game loop and neural network, where we train the agent with basic reinforcement learning principles.
Step 1: Create the Nimble Ninja Game

For simplicity, we'll use a basic 2D game loop. The player controls the Ninja, avoiding obstacles (such as flying enemies, obstacles, etc.). Here's a simple Swift-based game loop and Ninja class to get you started.
Example of the Game Setup:

import UIKit
import SpriteKit

class GameScene: SKScene {
    var ninja: SKSpriteNode!
    var scoreLabel: SKLabelNode!
    var gameStarted = false
    
    override func didMove(to view: SKView) {
        // Set up the scene
        ninja = SKSpriteNode(color: .blue, size: CGSize(width: 50, height: 50))
        ninja.position = CGPoint(x: frame.midX, y: frame.midY)
        addChild(ninja)

        scoreLabel = SKLabelNode(text: "Score: 0")
        scoreLabel.position = CGPoint(x: frame.midX, y: frame.maxY - 30)
        addChild(scoreLabel)
    }

    override func update(_ currentTime: TimeInterval) {
        if gameStarted {
            // Update game logic, e.g., obstacles and collisions
        }
    }
    
    func startGame() {
        gameStarted = true
        scoreLabel.text = "Score: 0"
    }
    
    func endGame() {
        gameStarted = false
        scoreLabel.text = "Game Over"
    }
    
    func moveNinja(to point: CGPoint) {
        let moveAction = SKAction.move(to: point, duration: 0.1)
        ninja.run(moveAction)
    }
}

In this code, we create a simple 2D game using SpriteKit, where the ninja is represented by a blue square that can move within the game scene.

    ninja: The player's character, which can move across the screen.
    scoreLabel: Displays the current score.
    startGame() and endGame(): Start and end the game.

Step 2: Integrating a Neural Network for AI

A simple way to apply a neural network here is to train an AI agent to control the Ninja using Reinforcement Learning (RL), where the agent learns to take actions (e.g., move the ninja) based on the game environment. In this case, we can use Q-Learning or a simple neural network approach.

You would typically train the agent through trial and error: move the ninja, receive feedback (reward/penalty), and adjust the model. For simplicity, we'll use a basic neural network approach using a fully connected network (e.g., using TensorFlow in a Swift-compatible library).

However, Swift 3 does not have direct support for machine learning, so we’ll create a skeleton that would hypothetically work once the correct neural network implementation is set up.
A Simple Neural Network Class (Swift 3 Skeleton):

In Swift 3, you may need a custom neural network implementation (though more modern versions of Swift support CoreML). Here’s how you might start setting up a neural network:

import Foundation
import Accelerate  // Useful for matrix operations in Swift

class NeuralNetwork {
    var weights: [Float]
    var bias: [Float]

    init(inputSize: Int, outputSize: Int) {
        self.weights = Array(repeating: Float.random(in: -1...1), count: inputSize * outputSize)
        self.bias = Array(repeating: Float.random(in: -1...1), count: outputSize)
    }

    func predict(input: [Float]) -> [Float] {
        var output = [Float](repeating: 0, count: bias.count)

        // Simple matrix multiplication and bias addition
        for i in 0..<output.count {
            output[i] = 0
            for j in 0..<input.count {
                output[i] += input[j] * weights[i * input.count + j]
            }
            output[i] += bias[i]
        }

        return output
    }

    func train(input: [Float], target: [Float], learningRate: Float) {
        // Basic gradient descent (placeholder)
        let prediction = predict(input: input)
        for i in 0..<prediction.count {
            let error = target[i] - prediction[i]
            // Update weights and biases based on the error
            for j in 0..<input.count {
                weights[i * input.count + j] += learningRate * error * input[j]
            }
            bias[i] += learningRate * error
        }
    }
}

This code creates a basic neural network class with random weights and biases. It implements a simple predict function and a placeholder train function using basic gradient descent.
Step 3: Integration into the Game

Now, we integrate the Neural Network into the Nimble Ninja game. Let’s say the neural network decides the best action for the ninja based on the environment. The state could be the ninja's position, obstacles' positions, and the action could be moving up, down, left, or right.

class NimbleNinjaAI {
    var neuralNetwork: NeuralNetwork
    
    init(inputSize: Int, outputSize: Int) {
        self.neuralNetwork = NeuralNetwork(inputSize: inputSize, outputSize: outputSize)
    }
    
    func decideAction(state: [Float]) -> Int {
        let output = neuralNetwork.predict(input: state)
        
        // Choose the action with the highest value
        let maxIndex = output.enumerated().max(by: { $0.element < $1.element })?.offset ?? 0
        return maxIndex
    }
}

In this example:

    The NimbleNinjaAI class uses a neural network to decide which action to take (e.g., move left, right, up, or down) based on the current game state (the ninja's position and any obstacles).
    The decideAction function calculates the action using the neural network’s prediction.

Step 4: Putting It All Together

Now that we have the game, the neural network, and the AI agent, we can start integrating everything. The AI will control the ninja based on the current game state. Here's how the integration might look in your GameScene class:

class GameScene: SKScene {
    var ninja: SKSpriteNode!
    var ai: NimbleNinjaAI!
    var scoreLabel: SKLabelNode!
    var gameStarted = false
    
    override func didMove(to view: SKView) {
        ninja = SKSpriteNode(color: .blue, size: CGSize(width: 50, height: 50))
        ninja.position = CGPoint(x: frame.midX, y: frame.midY)
        addChild(ninja)
        
        scoreLabel = SKLabelNode(text: "Score: 0")
        scoreLabel.position = CGPoint(x: frame.midX, y: frame.maxY - 30)
        addChild(scoreLabel)
        
        ai = NimbleNinjaAI(inputSize: 4, outputSize: 4)  // Example: 4 actions (left, right, up, down)
    }
    
    override func update(_ currentTime: TimeInterval) {
        if gameStarted {
            // Get the current game state (e.g., ninja position)
            let state: [Float] = [Float(ninja.position.x), Float(ninja.position.y), 0.0, 0.0]
            let action = ai.decideAction(state: state)
            
            // Execute the action (move the ninja)
            switch action {
            case 0:
                ninja.position.x -= 10
            case 1:
                ninja.position.x += 10
            case 2:
                ninja.position.y += 10
            case 3:
                ninja.position.y -= 10
            default:
                break
            }
        }
    }
}

Conclusion

This is a basic skeleton for the Nimble Ninja game with a simple neural network to control the game agent. The neural network is used to decide the best action for the ninja based on the current state, and the AI (in this case, using reinforcement learning principles) allows the ninja to play the game.

For a complete working version:

    Implementing actual reinforcement learning would require a more complex framework (training using Q-learning, for example).
    Depending on your use case, you may want to train the neural network in advance (using a Swift-compatible ML library like CoreML in later Swift versions).
    This code is a simplified example; a production-quality AI system would involve more sophisticated learning and feedback mechanisms.

If you plan to work with machine learning directly in Swift, consider using CoreML for easier integration with trained models, but that requires Swift 4 and later.
